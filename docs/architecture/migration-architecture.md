# Repository Migration Status

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of migrating from the current messy structure to a clean, organized repository following the gradual migration plan.

## Migration Phases

### âœ… Phase 1: Create Migration Infrastructure
- [x] Create `/current` directory for existing working code
- [x] Create `/unified` directory for new clean structure
- [x] Create `/legacy` directory for obsolete files
- [x] Create `/scripts` directory for migration utilities
- [x] Create this MIGRATION.md tracking file
- [x] Move documentation to `/unified/docs`
- [x] Create documentation index file

### âœ… Phase 2: Preserve Current Working Code
- [x] Move AI Dashboard to `/current/ai-dashboard/`
- [x] Move SQL Dashboard to `/current/sql-dashboard/`
- [x] Archive obsolete files to `/legacy/`
- [x] Create README files for each dashboard
- [x] Test import paths (all working)

### âœ… Phase 3: Build Unified Structure
- [x] Create shared infrastructure in `/unified/shared/`
  - Database adapters (base class + SQLite/MSSQL)
  - Caching system (3-tier cache manager)
  - Data models (CommodityInfo, PriceData, etc.)
  - Common utilities (config loader, logging)
- [x] Set up unified config in `/unified/config/`
  - Base configuration with all settings
  - Commodity definitions
  - Environment-specific configs (dev/prod)
- [x] Create feature modules in `/unified/src/features/`
  - AI insights module structure
  - Market data module structure
  - Analytics module structure
  - UI components module structure
- [x] Create unified entry point (`main.py`)

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 4: Migration Scripts
- [ ] Create migration utilities
- [ ] Build compatibility layer

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 5: Incremental Feature Migration
- [ ] Migrate shared components
- [ ] Migrate AI dashboard features
- [ ] Migrate SQL dashboard features

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 6: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests
- [ ] Parallel run validation

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 7: Documentation and Cleanup
- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Final cleanup

## Migration Log

### January 2025
- **Jan 17** - Phase 1 completed:
  - Created directory structure (/current, /unified, /legacy, /scripts)
  - Created MIGRATION.md tracking file
  - Moved and organized all documentation to /unified/docs
  - Created documentation index for easy navigation

- **Jan 17** - Phase 2 completed:
  - Moved AI Dashboard to `/current/ai-dashboard/` with main.py entry point
  - Moved SQL Dashboard to `/current/sql-dashboard/` with main.py entry point
  - Archived obsolete files to `/legacy/`
  - Moved migration script to `/scripts/`
  - Created README files for each dashboard
  - Tested imports - all working correctly

- **Jan 17** - Phase 3 completed:
  - Created shared infrastructure in `/unified/shared/`
    - Database abstraction layer
    - Three-tier caching system
    - Unified data models
    - Configuration loader and logging
  - Set up unified configuration system
    - Base config with all settings
    - Environment-specific configs
    - Commodity definitions
  - Created feature module structure
    - AI insights, market data, analytics, UI components
  - Created unified entry point with dashboard launcher

- **Jan 17** - Post-Phase 3 Cleanup:
  - Organized legacy folder with clear subdirectories:
    - `/legacy/ai-dashboard-original/` - Original AI dashboard files from root
    - `/legacy/sql-dashboard-original/` - Original SQL dashboard (Commodities-Dashboard-v2)
  - Moved duplicate files to legacy (files were copied, not moved in Phase 2)
  - Moved `migrate_to_mssql.py` to `/scripts/` where it belongs
  - Created README.md in legacy folder documenting archived files
  - **Note:** Original files were duplicated during Phase 2, not moved. Legacy folder now contains the originals for reference

## Notes

### Important Considerations
1. Preserve `.env` file location (keep at root for now)
2. Both dashboards must remain functional during migration
3. Update import paths after moving files
4. Test each dashboard after moving

### Quick Commands

```bash
# CURRENT LOCATIONS (Use these):

# Run AI Dashboard
streamlit run current/ai-dashboard/main.py

# Run SQL Dashboard
streamlit run current/sql-dashboard/main.py

# LEGACY LOCATIONS (archived - do not use):

# AI Dashboard (moved to legacy)
# Was: streamlit run app.py
# Now archived at: legacy/ai-dashboard-original/app.py

# SQL Dashboard (moved to legacy)
# Was: streamlit run Commodities-Dashboard-v2/Home.py
# Now archived at: legacy/sql-dashboard-original/Commodities-Dashboard-v2/Home.py
```

## Next Steps
1. âœ… Phase 1: Documentation organization - COMPLETED
2. âœ… Phase 2: Preserve working code - COMPLETED
3. ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: Build unified structure in `/unified`
4. ðŸ“‹ Phase 4: Create migration scripts
5. ðŸ“‹ Phase 5: Incremental feature migration
